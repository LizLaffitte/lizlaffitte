### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LOnt6uqjD9OexmQJRB/giphy.gif" width="25px" />
I am a Full Stack Developer working in Digital Marketing. I first fell in love with programming when I had the opportunity to learn how to code HTML emails so that they look good in **all** versions of Outlook. 

I completed the Software Engineering bootcamp at Flatiron Schools, where I took a deep dive into Ruby, Rails, React, Redux and JavaScript.

🔭 I’m currently working on a Ruby gem that will make my life easier by adding client blog info right into AirTable, using the WordPress and AirTable APIs. I'm also working on adding a map feature to my [Dads & Diapers](https://dads-and-diapers.herokuapp.com/) application.

⚡ Fun fact: Being a native Floridian means I've always had non-traditional pets including a raccoon, a turkey, and a flying squirrel. Right now we have a 13 year old fur baby 🐕 and 4 chickens 🐔.
