### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LOnt6uqjD9OexmQJRB/giphy.gif" width="25px" />
I am a software developer working as a Salesforce Developer for a non-profit trade association. I first fell in love with programming when I had the opportunity to learn how to code HTML emails so that they look good in **all** versions of Outlook. 

I completed the Software Engineering bootcamp at Flatiron Schools, where I took a deep dive into Ruby, Rails, React, Redux and JavaScript.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a LWC that will pull bank data from the FDIC's BankFind Suite API and upsert records in Salesforce.

âš¡ Fun fact: My hobbies include cross stitch, hiking, geocaching and buying my kid Lego sets so I can put them together.
