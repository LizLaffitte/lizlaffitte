### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/LOnt6uqjD9OexmQJRB/giphy.gif" width="25px" />
I am a software developer currently working as a Salesforce Developer for a personal injury law firm. I first fell in love with programming when I had the opportunity to learn how to code HTML emails so that they look good in **all** versions of Outlook. 

I completed the Software Engineering bootcamp at Flatiron Schools, where I took a deep dive into Ruby, Rails, React, Redux and JavaScript. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on LWCs that:
- Use the Docrio and Salesforce APIs to create multiple documents in one go
- Allow management to use historical Salesforce to forecase future performance
- Make API calls to Hubspot to create/update data in the CMS 

âš¡ Fun fact: My hobbies include crocheting, exploring, geocaching and buying my kid Lego sets so I can put them together.
